# BERRY-IT-WinForge

WinForge is my one-person PowerShell project designed to simplify setting up a Windows machine. It’s a work-in-progress, so expect frequent changes and fixes. Use at your own risk - I take no liability for any issues it causes.

Automate App Installs
Wraps elevation, silent-install switches and dependency checks into one interface so you don’t have to run each installer manually (when it works).

Real-Time Feedback
Shows progress bars for each package and maintains a rolling log so you don’t have to hunt through folders or Event Viewer when something goes wrong.

Save Your Favorites
Store your go-to toolset as a profile and replicate it on any fresh OS or VM with one click. Profiles may break as features change.

Easy to Customize
Built with PowerShell and XAML so you can swap in your own scripts, point at internal repos or tweak the UI yourself.

Lightweight and Portable
Made for one IT engineer’s workflow, with no enterprise bloat or installers required. Runs wherever PowerShell runs (some modules may not load).

Disclaimer: 
This is a hobby project under constant development. It may break at any time, behave unpredictably or require manual fixes. Use at your own risk - I accept no responsibility or liability for data loss, system issues or downtime.
